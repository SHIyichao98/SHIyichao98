## Yichao Shi

Yichao Shi is a Ph.D. student in Architecture with a specialization in Design Computation at the Georgia Institute of Technology, where he also serves as an instructor. He holds a Bachelor of Engineering in Architectural Engineering from Tongji University, a Master of Architecture in Architectural Design from University College London (UCL), and a Master of Science in Design Computation from Georgia Tech.

Yichao's research interests include computational design, parametric modeling, shape grammars, computer-aided design (CAD), digital heritage, computer graphics, cognitive science, and human-computer interaction. He has significant expertise in integrating advanced AI technologies into architectural design processes, particularly utilizing generative AI tools such as pix2pix GAN, Midjourney, Stable Diffusion Web UI, and Comfy UI.

Currently, Yichao is exploring the use of multimodal and multi-model large language models (LLMs) to develop AI-driven agent models capable of interpreting and evaluating architectural design logic. His ongoing work focuses on inverting generative rules and processes through AI, aiming to enhance problem-solving capabilities within architectural design contexts.
